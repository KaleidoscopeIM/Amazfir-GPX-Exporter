# Amazfir-GPX-Exporter
Amazfit GPX Data Exporter
1. connect amazfit watch
2. download all jar files and run amazfit_GPX_Export.jar.
3. It export all gpx data of all running tracks from amazfit and it store in gpxdata folder. 

There is so many websites online where we can upload gpx data and view on map.
I personally use : www.mygeodata.cloud (UI is cool of this site) or you can also use most widly used site www.gpsvisualizer.com
